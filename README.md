# Karol Sytwu Portfolio

## Description

This project involves creating a web application from scratch. An effective portfolio showcases our best class work and the thought processes behind it. The portfolio will include my name, a recent photo, and a navigation section with links to the following: About Me, My Work, My Resume, and Contact Information.

## Usage

An employer wants to provide a platform for viewing a potential employeeâ€™s deployed portfolio, which includes various work samples. The portfolio demonstrates the projects I have completed during the Bootcamp, showcasing the knowledge and skills I have acquired. My repository adheres to best practices for file structure and naming conventions, and it features
a detailed README file with descriptions, screenshots, and links to deployed applications.
